# Portfolio Miguel Gambão
This Portfolio Website was created for the Web Development course from the Master's in Design and Media.

The portfolio features an header section that has a display text with images from past works going around it and over it. The whole aesthetic is based on the excluison blending mode. It also features a section with info about me also using the same method for the images in the header, but using pictures of cats provided by the cat API (https://thecatapi.com/). Next it features a section with a grid of my projects, where you can select which one you want to expand and see details for. Currently only the first one, Arquivo Urbano is set up with info, but including more of them would be easy as it the page was made in a modular way.
Lastly it contains a section with my contact info, and a footer.

The main nav in the top can send you to the different parts of the page, but you can also navigate the page by using the arrow buttons in the bottom right. When you reach the bottom there is also a button on the footer to send you back up to the top.

The whole website is responsive, being available and optimized for almost all screen sizes.

The project is not finished at this point (11/11/2025), and will probably be finished and iterated in the future and used for a personal and professional website.

There are no other requirements other than HTML, JS and CSS support.
